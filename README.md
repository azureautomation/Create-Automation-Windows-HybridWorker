# Create Automation Windows HybridWorker
 This runbook aids users in Creating Windows User Hybrid workers.
 This script must be executed on a Run As Enabled Automation Account only.   
 This would require the following modules to be present in the Automation account :  
 Az.Accounts, Az.Resources, Az.Automation, Az.OperationalInsights, Az.Compute 

 The script could even create (if needed) a Log Analaytics Workspace and also a VM to be registered as User Hybrid worker.
